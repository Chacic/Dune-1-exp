      <h2>Gravity Ball</h2>
      <p>
        Gravity Ball is a game played in a zero-gravity environment. The arena is a room covered with metal handrails extending from the walls. These handrails are used by players to navigate in zero gravity. The main object in this game is a ball, the size of a football. The goal is to place this ball inside the hoop of the opposing team. The absence of gravity adds an exciting challenge, requiring strategic movement and teamwork.

      <h2>Space Golf</h2>
      <p>
        Space Golf is a special mini-golf course developed specifically for the zero-gravity environment. Because of the challenges presented by zero gravity, traditional golf clubs are difficult to use. Instead, controlled air guns are utilized. Players can adjust the power and direction to precisely position the ball inside the hole. Navigating the course becomes an engaging challenge, making Space Golf a unique and enjoyable experience.

      <h2>Flying Ball</h2>
      <p>
        Flying Ball is a complex zero-gravity game cleverly designed to utilize different laws of physics. The main object is a ball with a small hole, creating propulsion for the ball. Players, equipped with special RCS (Reaction Control System) backpacks and magnetic controllers, control the direction of the ball. The main goal is to navigate this ball into the enemy's special zone. It challenges players' coordination and understanding of motion in a zero-gravity environment.
